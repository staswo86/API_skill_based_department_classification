**Skill based department classification project**
This text classifier aims to determine a suitable IT department based on candidate's skills.

There are four distinct IT department, where a possible candidate can be selected namely
* Data Science & AI
* IT Software Engineering
* Cyber Security
* ERP

The model was fine-tuned from DistilBERT on a relatively small LLM generated dataset(https://huggingface.co/datasets/staswo86/skill_based_department_classification_dataset).

The detailed information about the model, dataset, and demo implemented via Gradio is publicly available on my Hugging Face profile https://huggingface.co/staswo86.
